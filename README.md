# VisualPDESliders
A tiny Javascript file that enables you to include HTML sliders that can interact directly with VisualPDE.com simulations running in iframes. Just include it in your document and away you go.

## Usage
Include the ``vpde-sliders.js`` or ``vpde-sliders.min.js`` in your HTML.
```
<script src="path/to/vpde-sliders.js" defer></script>
```

This defines a new ``vpde-slider`` HTML element that attaches to a VisualPDE simulation running in an iframe.
